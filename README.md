## Phase 1: Set Up and Planning
In this phase, I am setting up my Azure Account and subscription that I was provided. I was given $200 in credit for Azure to use however I'd like so I will be using it for this project, which I feel highlights many technological skills I have been learning in the Server and Cloud Administration cohort through the Microsoft and Systems Academy.
