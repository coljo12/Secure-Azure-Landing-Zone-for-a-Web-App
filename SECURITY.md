# Security Review Report

## Overview
This document outlines security issues identified in the Secure Azure Landing Zone repository and provides recommendations for remediation.

## Critical Security Issues

### 1. **Exposed Azure Subscription ID**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `images/SubSetupNotif.png`

**Issue:**  
The subscription setup notification image exposes the Azure Subscription ID: `46bfe74b-916d-45ed-a2ad-ec04118c3cf7`

**Risk:**  
Exposing subscription IDs can enable attackers to:
- Target specific Azure subscriptions for reconnaissance
- Attempt social engineering attacks
- Combine with other leaked credentials to gain unauthorized access
- Enumerate resources associated with the subscription

**Recommendation:**
- Remove or redact the subscription ID from all images
- Replace with a placeholder like `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`
- Consider using mock/sanitized screenshots for documentation

---

### 2. **Personal Information Exposure**
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `images/SubSetupNotif.png`

**Issue:**  
The subscription name "MSSA August 2025 Tre McGowan" reveals:
- Personal name (Tre McGowan)
- Educational affiliation (MSSA)
- Enrollment timeframe (August 2025)

**Risk:**
- Privacy violation
- Potential for targeted phishing or social engineering
- Identifies the account holder for malicious actors

**Recommendation:**
- Redact personal information from screenshots
- Use generic names like "My Azure Subscription" or "Project Subscription"
- Blur or mask personal identifiers before sharing publicly

---

### 3. **HTTP Traffic Allowed (Insecure Protocol)**
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** Network Security Group rules shown in `images/NSGWebRulesOutbound.png` and described in README.md

**Issue:**  
The NSG rules allow both HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) traffic:
- Inbound rule: "allow all HTTPS and HTTP traffic"
- Outbound rule: "Allow-HTTPS-HTTP-Outbound" allowing ports 443 and 80

**Risk:**
- HTTP traffic is unencrypted and vulnerable to:
  - Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks
  - Eavesdropping and data interception
  - Session hijacking
  - Credential theft
- Violates security best practices for web applications
- Contradicts the project goal of deploying "a web app with managed identity and HTTPS"

**Recommendation:**
- **Remove HTTP (port 80)** from all NSG rules
- Only allow HTTPS (port 443) for web traffic
- If HTTP support is needed, implement HTTP to HTTPS redirect at the application layer
- Update documentation to reflect HTTPS-only configuration
- Consider implementing Azure Front Door or Application Gateway with SSL/TLS termination

---

### 4. **Broken Image Reference**
**Severity:** LOW  
**Location:** `README.md` line 18

**Issue:**  
The image reference `![Subscription Setup Notification](images/ResourceGroupCreation)` is missing a file extension.

**Risk:**
- Documentation appears broken/unprofessional
- May indicate incomplete or missing security screenshots

**Recommendation:**
- Verify the correct file extension (.png, .jpg, etc.)
- Update the reference to include the proper extension
- Ensure the image file exists and is accessible

---

## Additional Security Recommendations

### 5. **Zero Trust Implementation**
**Current State:**  
The README mentions trying to "enforce zero trust" through deny-all rules.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement Azure Active Directory (AAD) integration for authentication
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all accounts
- Use Azure Private Endpoints to avoid public internet exposure
- Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) VM access if VMs are used
- Enable Azure Security Center/Microsoft Defender for Cloud
- Use Network Segmentation with multiple subnets (web tier, app tier, data tier)

### 6. **Monitoring and Logging**
**Recommendations:**
- Enable Azure Monitor and Application Insights
- Configure diagnostic logs for all NSGs
- Set up Azure Security Center alerts
- Enable Azure Activity Log for audit trails
- Implement log retention policies
- Consider SIEM integration for advanced threat detection

### 7. **Managed Identity and Secrets Management**
**Recommendations:**
- Use Azure Managed Identity for service-to-service authentication
- Store secrets in Azure Key Vault
- Rotate keys and secrets regularly
- Never commit credentials to source control
- Use Azure Key Vault references in App Service configuration

### 8. **Network Security Enhancements**
**Recommendations:**
- Implement Application Gateway with Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Use Azure DDoS Protection Standard
- Consider Azure Firewall for centralized network security
- Implement Network Watcher for traffic analysis
- Use Service Endpoints or Private Link for Azure services

### 9. **Documentation Security**
**Best Practices:**
- Always sanitize screenshots before publishing
- Use mock data for examples
- Never include:
  - Subscription IDs or Tenant IDs
  - Resource IDs
  - IP addresses
  - Personal information
  - Connection strings or credentials
  - API keys or tokens
- Consider using architecture diagrams instead of actual portal screenshots

## Summary of Required Actions

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. ✅ Remove or replace `images/SubSetupNotif.png` with a redacted version
2. ✅ Update NSG rules to remove HTTP (port 80) support - HTTPS only
3. ✅ Update README.md to reflect HTTPS-only configuration

### Short-term Actions (Medium Priority)
4. ✅ Redact personal information from all screenshots
5. ✅ Fix broken image reference in README.md
6. ✅ Add security best practices section to README

### Long-term Actions (Recommended)
7. Review and implement additional security recommendations
8. Enable Azure Security Center/Microsoft Defender
9. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
10. Document incident response procedures

---

## Conclusion

This repository demonstrates good foundational security practices with NSG rules and network segmentation. However, several critical issues must be addressed:

1. **Data Exposure:** Sensitive Azure subscription information and personal data are publicly visible
2. **Insecure Protocols:** HTTP traffic should be completely disabled in favor of HTTPS-only
3. **Documentation:** Images must be sanitized before publication

By addressing these issues, this project will better align with Azure security best practices and serve as a stronger portfolio piece.
