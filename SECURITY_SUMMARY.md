# Security Review Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive security review has been completed for this Azure Landing Zone repository. This document provides a quick summary of findings. For detailed information, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Critical Findings

### üî¥ High Severity Issues

1. **Exposed Azure Subscription ID**
   - **File:** `images/SubSetupNotif.png`
   - **Issue:** Subscription ID `46bfe74b-916d-45ed-a2ad-ec04118c3cf7` is visible
   - **Action Required:** Replace or redact the image before making the repository public

2. **HTTP Protocol Enabled**
   - **Location:** NSG rules in Phase 2
   - **Issue:** Port 80 (HTTP) is allowed alongside HTTPS
   - **Action Required:** Remove HTTP support, use HTTPS-only (port 443)

### üü° Medium Severity Issues

3. **Personal Information Exposed**
   - **File:** `images/SubSetupNotif.png`
   - **Issue:** Name and educational affiliation visible
   - **Action Required:** Redact personal information from screenshots

### üü¢ Low Severity Issues

4. **Broken Image Reference** ‚úÖ FIXED
   - **Issue:** Missing .png extension on ResourceGroupCreation image
   - **Status:** Resolved - file renamed to ResourceGroupCreation.png

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ Completed Actions

1. **Created SECURITY.md**
   - Comprehensive security assessment
   - Detailed risk analysis for each issue
   - Actionable recommendations
   - Best practices and additional security enhancements

2. **Updated README.md**
   - Added security notice at the top
   - Added inline warnings for sensitive images
   - Added warnings about HTTP vs HTTPS
   - Added Security Best Practices section
   - Fixed broken image reference
   - Corrected all image alt text descriptions

3. **Added .gitignore**
   - Prevents accidental commit of credentials
   - Excludes temporary files and editor configs
   - Protects Azure publish settings and state files

4. **Fixed Image File**
   - Renamed `ResourceGroupCreation` to `ResourceGroupCreation.png`

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Do Before Making Public)

1. **Replace SubSetupNotif.png**
   - Use image editing software to blur/redact:
     - Subscription ID
     - Personal name
     - Email or other identifying information
   - Or recreate with mock data

2. **Update NSG Rules**
   - Remove HTTP (port 80) from all NSG rules
   - Keep only HTTPS (port 443)
   - Update screenshots to reflect HTTPS-only configuration

### Short-term Improvements

3. **Enhance Documentation**
   - Add architecture diagram (without sensitive data)
   - Document the security controls in detail
   - Include deployment instructions

4. **Implement Additional Security**
   - Enable Azure Security Center/Microsoft Defender
   - Set up Azure Monitor and Application Insights
   - Configure diagnostic logging for NSGs
   - Implement Azure Key Vault for secrets

### Long-term Enhancements

5. **Complete the Landing Zone**
   - Deploy the web application
   - Implement managed identity
   - Configure HTTPS with valid SSL/TLS certificates
   - Set up cost monitoring and alerts

6. **Add Infrastructure as Code**
   - Consider using Terraform or Bicep templates
   - Version control your infrastructure
   - Enable reproducible deployments

## Security Best Practices Applied

‚úÖ Defense in Depth - Multiple security layers  
‚úÖ Zero Trust principles - Deny-all rules with explicit allows  
‚úÖ Network segmentation - Separate NSGs for web and secure tiers  
‚ö†Ô∏è HTTPS-only - **Still needs implementation**  
‚ö†Ô∏è Data protection - **Screenshots need redaction**
